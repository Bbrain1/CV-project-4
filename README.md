### What operating system and IDE you used to run and compile your code.
With minor tweaks, this system should run on windows or mac, however, the uploaded code is optimized for a mac using Xcode. For testing purposes, using Xcode would be the preferred method. 

### Instructions for running your executables.
Most of the executabiles are run via letter selection or via the command line. Prior to running the code, however, there are two places where you will need to change the absolute path of the file so it saves correctly. In part 1, navigate to Task3 file and change the absolute path on line 46. In part 2, navigate to task 4 and change the absolute path on line 31.

Part 1 instructions:
- Run the program
- Select 1 to turn on pattern finding
- Select c to save a calibration image. You will need at least 5 images, but taking more will improve the calibration. Move the camera slowly around the object while calibrating for optimal performance. 
- Select m to save the calibration. The command line will prompt you to enter your name. 

*NOTE - depending on the file path that you indicated, you may need to copy the json calibration file over to part2. If you are receiving hardware issues after entering your name in part 2, this is likely why*

Part 2 instructions:
- Run the program
- Enter the same name used to saved the calibration json in part 1 when prompted by the command line
- Select x to show the checkerboard pattern
- Select y to plot the 3D axis
- Select z to plot the virtual objects (2 prisms going in opposite z plane directions)
- Select w to show the key features of the program


### Instructions for testing any extensions you completed.
As a continuation from the tasks outlines in Part 2:
- Select b to blur out the target pattern
- Select c to add a checker piece a user specified location
- in response to the command line, enter a xstart value between -1 and 6, and a ystart value between -1 and 9. 

### Whether you are using any time travel days and how many.
None
